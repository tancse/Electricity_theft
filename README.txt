ABSTRACT

Electricity theft is a widespread issue with far-reaching consequences, negatively impacting both utility companies and consumers. This pervasive problem not only hampers the economic development of utility providers but also poses risks of electrical hazards while contributing to the overall high cost of energy for end-users. In response to this challenge, the emergence of smart grids has proven pivotal in detecting electricity theft. These advanced systems generate extensive datasets, encompassing customer consumption information. Leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques, this project introduces an innovative theft detection method that employs comprehensive features in both time and frequency domains within a deep neural network-based classification approach.
In the existing system, the prediction algorithm relies on DNN (Deep Neural Network), which may exhibit limitations in accurately capturing the intricate temporal dependencies present in the data. Consequently, this can lead to lower prediction accuracy, particularly in tasks involving time-series data. To address this drawback, a proposed enhancement involves integrating LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) with TLGRU (Temporal Logic Gated Recurrent Unit). This hybrid model combines the strengths of both LSTM and TLGRU architectures to improve prediction accuracy. LSTM is known for its ability to capture long-term dependencies, while TLGRU incorporates temporal logic mechanisms to enhance the model's understanding of temporal relationships and events within the data. By integrating LSTM with TLGRU, the model gains the capacity to effectively capture and reason about complex temporal dynamics, thereby mitigating the limitations associated with solely relying on DNN. As a result, the proposed LSTM-TLGRU hybrid model is expected to offer superior prediction accuracy, making it well-suited for tasks requiring precise forecasting or analysis of time-series data, such as electricity consumption prediction or financial market forecasting.
